# Portfolio Optimization
This repo mostly contains coding exercises and examples that I come across during my self-learning journey about portfolio optimization. I chose Julia because it is a language that I wanted to learn and, becaus most of the code out there for this topic is written in Matlab, I can translate it to Julia without much effort. The initial part of the material follows the book [Portfolio Optimization][1] from Michael Best.
